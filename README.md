### Getting Started
- Fill in your username, generate an OAuth, pick which chat it should listen to
- Create a binding of chat messages->key pressed using the "Edit" button at the top
- Select the window for it to send the key presses to
- Connect to Twitch with the "Connect Button"
- Click "Start Playing" to let Twitch Chat start playing!
- (Optional) Click "Create Overlay" to get a neat little window that you can easily add to OBS that just shows the keys pressed by chat!
