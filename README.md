TwitchPlaysBot
==============

A Windows client for streamers to create "Twitch Plays" crowd-sourced gameplay experiences, inspired by [TwitchPlaysPokemon](http://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon). Rather than focusing on one particular emulator or game, the client allows you to send commands to any active application window, while the configurable joypad allows custom commands and key press combinations. Connect the client to IRC, create your overlay, set up a simple [Open Broadcast Software](http://obsproject.com) scene and away you go!
